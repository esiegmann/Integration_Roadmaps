## Detailed Instructions

This contact(s) will work with Allocations and/or other ACCESS tracks to provide documentation/user guides for each of their resources. The contact will be the main liaison for Allocations as well as user community and review panels. RP contact will need to provide available resource information, review proposals of smaller Allocation requests. Contact will need to provide resource information for RDR of resource(s) and keep RDR updated for the life of resource(s). Email [*help@xsede.org*](mailto:help@xsede.org) with subject “Track 1 Roadmaps - allocations contact” or email [*hackwort@psc.edu*](mailto:hackwort@psc.edu) to provide contact details.  
  
Instructions for entering resource information are specified in a later roadmap step: [*Infrastructure Description*](Infrastructure_Description_v2.md)

## Operating Instructions

RPs who are designed as Allocations Contacts, who are responsible for reviewing requests for their resources and ensuring their site's documentation is up to date, are encouraged to utilize the following tools & resources to assist with their involvement in the Allocations process. Feedback related to this document (and ACCESS Allocation Services as a whole) is welcomed through our [feedback form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdn-SXokNB_5s0r2SA_S9ZIZWZFlVPRD2OHepTH5HY2YND_zw/viewform).

* XRAS ([eXtensible Resource Allocation Service](https://allocations.access-ci.org/about-xras)) 
    * The main tool under constant development and refinement for ACCESS Allocations. The software suite provides distinct interfaces for Submit, Review, and Administration components required for end-to-end services 
* [Allocations Review Site](https://review-access.xras.org/login) 
    * Serves as the mechanism to review requests for your resource(s). We recommend that you bookmark this page!
* [Reviewer Manual](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s0TLyKTXrKFjjVGJxE-7nwyzHfAwX-sjjBOJbsiprf4/edit#)
    * Documents the allocations cycle and review guidelines. We recommend that you regularly refer to this documentation as you complete any and all review assignments
* [Reviewer Training & DEI](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-ENSP1gvqGi5H2w_bKjwr6ocvVJaT-kw) 
    * In order to create an open, inviting, and democratized allocations marketplace various training and reference materials are provided
* [Allocations Queries](https://xacct-admin.access-ci.org/allocations_queries)

    * A credit exchange rate must be established by the Resource Provider for the systems they will allocate. This is done through the [CyberInfrastructure Description Repository (CiDeR)](https://cider.access-ci.org/login)
    * RPs can contact Allocations if they have questions on setting their exchange rate
* [Resource Catalog](https://allocations.access-ci.org/resources)
